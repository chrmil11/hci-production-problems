## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#understanding-accessibility
2. https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

  1. User responsive design to ensure that your website loads on any device without any issues.
  2. Have a clear hierarchy of importance by contrasting different elements based on size and ordering. Group related elements together.
  3. If your form is too long, split it up in a few pages. Make it as plain and simple as possible.
  4. Add concise and comprehensive hints to the input fields and warn the user if they make a mistake on the form so that they can go back and fix it.
  5. Assure that major tasks can be completed by everyone, including users with impairments.
  6. Have complementary visual cues (like hint text) to help colorblind users figure out what elements are being highlighted (ie: for warnings).
  7. Have readable fonts, scalable text, relevant and meaningful images, and contrasting colors.
  8. Create simple tests/tasks to guide the user on using the site and collect their feedback about the experience.
  9. Avoid staying control types or states. Use short descriptions that describe what the element is for.
  10. Clear and easy-to-locate navigation and focus controls.
