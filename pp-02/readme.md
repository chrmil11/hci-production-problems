1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14R0u0kskp-bfFrkZtuxjjmNubs
Your Rationale: I went with a cool color because warm colors personally felt too "bright" and "vibrant" in contrast to the context of a gaming platform. I chose purple in particular because it's a color that can represent creativity, and I think tying it to the innovation of a new gaming platform would be a perfect fit. On the palette I made sure to include both light and dark variants of purple which would help provide more variety of how we can accent material.
